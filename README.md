# Home Weather Station weather website template for Cumulus/Cumulus MX

This repository contains the current version of Brian Underdown's Home Weather Station weather website template set.
Brian's main website is https://weather34.com/homeweatherstation/index.html
In January, 2019, Brian has asked others to distribute/maintain his code for other weather station software,
and is only supporting Meteobridge/Meteobridge NANO-SD versions of the HWS template.

This version requires Cumulus software (either Cumulus 1.9.4 Windows or Cumulus MX) for data feeds for the conditions 
from your personal weather station.  Cumulus and Cumulus MX software is available from the Cumulus Wiki at https://cumuluswiki.wxforum.net/a/Software  Cumulus 1.9.4 is *not maintained* but still functional on Windows systems.
Cumulus MX is supported and maintained by Mark Crossley at https://github.com/mcrossley/CumulusMX
