# Home Weather Station weather website template for Cumulus/Cumulus MX

This repository contains the current version of Brian Underdown's Home Weather Station weather website template set.
Brian's main website is https://weather34.com/homeweatherstation/index.html
In January, 2019, Brian has asked others to distribute/maintain his code for other weather station software,
and is only supporting Meteobridge/Meteobridge NANO-SD versions of the HWS template.

This version requires Cumulus software (either Cumulus 1.9.4 Windows or Cumulus MX) for data feeds for the conditions 
from your personal weather station.
